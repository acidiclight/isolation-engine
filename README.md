# Isolation engine

A game engine powered by spite that will never charge runtime fees. This engine is written by the lead programmer at [Trixel Creative](https://trixelcreative.com/) as a hobby project, and as the engine for an up-coming game, **Socially Distant.**


Isolation Engine tries to closely emulate Unity's core game framework in an effort to make porting Unity games easier. Under the hood, it uses FNA for graphics rendering, audio, windowing, and input. Its UI system is also designed to closely mimic UGUI in functionality.


## Why the name?

The name "Isolation Engine" has two meanings.

1. It relates to the primary narrative of Socially Distant.
2. It represents the core philosophy of the engine, to isolate itself from the business of its end-users.
Whether you see this engine as a protest of Unity's recent runtime fee announcements is up to you. I, however, simply see it as a wrench.

This wrench is good at being a wrench, and it will do what it's designed to do. This wrench knows, and hopes that, it will be used by people to build useful things with. This wrench is happy to do that, solely for the benefit of man-kind. This wrench doesn't care how many times it has been used to fasten something together, nor does it care how many people have used that now-fastened object. This wrench will certainly never stab its owner or charge them a fee based on how many users have used objects fastened by the owner using this wrench. This wrench has no desire to bankrupt you, it's just a wrench.


## This is a stub repo

Naturally, game engines are difficult to write - even if much of the work is done for me by FNA. Expect a very large commit here once I've had time to get some basic demos up and running.
